circles that is friends and family into one group. It also provides live location sharing
with Google Maps integration, which enables users to exchange real time location
updates and the directions, thereby improving safety and convenience. Snapchat
Enhanced provides a Quiet Mode feature that offers a more focused and streamlined
user experience that lets users turn off notifications during study or work without

User Interface and appeal of the platform's content according to their choice. By
means of these improvements, Snapchat Enhanced presents a more simplified, private,
and user-friendly experience, thereby assuring that every function not only addresses
important issues but also guarantees a more seamless, more linked social experience.
